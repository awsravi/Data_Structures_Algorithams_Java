1)Middle Function
  Write a function called middle that takes an array and returns a new array that contains all but the first and last elements.

  myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  middle(myArray)  # [2,3].

2)2D Arrays
    Given 2D array calculate the sum of diagonal elements.

    Example
    myArray2D= {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};
    sumDiagonalElements(myArray2D) # 15

3)Best Score
Given an array, write a function to get first, second best scores from the array and return it in new array.
  Array may contain duplicates.

  Example
  myArray = {84,85,86,87,85,90,85,83,23,45,84,1,2,0}
  firstSecond(myArray) // {90, 87}

4)Missing Number
  Write Java function called findMissingNumberInArray that takes an integer array containing n-1 unique elements from a range of 1 to n, with one missing number, and returns the missing number.

  Example

  myArray = {1,2,3,4,6}
  findMissingNumberInArray(myArray, 6) // 5
  Hint:
  Use the formula (n * (n + 1)) / 2 which  calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers.

5)Duplicate Number
  Write a function which takes integer array as a parameter and returns a new integer array with unique elements. (remove duplicates)

  Example

  removeDuplicates({1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5})
  Output : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

6)
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array - LeetCode 26
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example:

Input: nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 2

7)Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - LeetCode 121
  You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

  Example:

  Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
  Output: 5
  Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

8)Two Sum - LeetCode 1
  Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

  Examples

  Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
  Output: [0,1]
  Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]


  Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
  Output: [1,2]

9)Finding a Number in an Array
  Write a program to to check if an array contains a number in Java.

  int[] intArray = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
  searchInArray(intArray, 6); // 5

10)Max Product of Two Integers
   How to find maximum product of two integers in the array where all elements are positive.

   Example

   int[] intArray = {10,20,30,40,50};
   maxProduct(intArray) // (40,50)

11)IsUnique / Contains Duplicate - LeetCode 217
   Write a program to check if an array is unique or not.

   Example

   int[] intArray = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
   isUnique(intArray) // true

12)Permutation
   Your are given two integer arrays. Write a program to check if they are permutation of each other.

   Example

   int[] array1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
   int[] array2 = {5,1,2,3,4};
   permutation(array1, array2)
   Output

   true

13)Rotate Matrix
   Given an image represented by an NxN matrix write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.

   You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.

   DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
   input:123456789
   output:741852962
